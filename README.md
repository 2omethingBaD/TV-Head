# CRT TV Head

Arduino code and circuit diagram for my tv head costume. This project registers button presses to cycle through animations that are then displayed on the LED matrix board. This project runs on a TISEKER Mini Nano V3.0 ATmega328P Microcontroller Board.

## The circuit

The circuit is powered by a 9V battery and features a single LED to indicate power, along with 5 buttons (meant one to be placed on each finger for easier control) that control the display.

The LED matrix was then made by cutting a pre-bought LED strip and soldering the points together.

## The finished product

After testing both the code and circuit, the matrix and circuit was fitted into the hollowed-out CRT TV shell. Later, an on/off button was added to the circuit for easier control.
