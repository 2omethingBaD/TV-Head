# TV Head Costume

## Overview
This repository contains the Arduino code and circuit diagram for my TV head costume project. The costume features a LED matrix board that displays various animations controlled by button presses.

## Circuit Design
### Initial Configuration
The circuit is powered by a 9V battery and features a single LED to indicate power. It utilizes a TISEKER Mini Nano V3.0 ATmega328P Microcontroller Board for seamless operation. Originally, the setup featured five buttons, each intended for placement on individual fingers to facilitate easier control. However, recent modifications have streamlined the design to incorporate four front-facing buttons, complemented by a larger button for overall power control.

### LED Matrix Creation
The LED matrix was crafted by cutting and soldering a pre-purchased LED strip to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing display.

## Costume Assembly
### Comfort Enhancements
To guarantee a comfortable fit, a custom-fitted helmet was integrated into the TV casing. Liquid nail adhesive secured the helmet in place, further supported by strategically placed foam for added comfort.

## Final Display
### Integration and Testing
After successful testing of both the code and circuit, the LED matrix and associated circuitry were seamlessly fitted into the hollowed-out CRT TV shell, creating a visually striking and functional TV head costume.
